# Data Directory

## foods.json

**DEPRECATED**: This file is no longer used by the application. Food data is now stored in the SQLite database (`system_food` table) and seeded from `src/data/foods.json` in the root app.

This file is kept temporarily for reference but will be removed in a future cleanup.
