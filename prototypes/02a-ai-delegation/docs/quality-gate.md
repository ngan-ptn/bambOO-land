# Design Quality Gate: 02a-ai-delegation (AI-Delegated Features)

**Date:** 2025-01-11
**Phase:** Build

---

## Gate: Concept Clarity
- [x] Core value understandable in ≤10s? (AI-assisted Vietnamese food tracking)
- [x] One-sentence pitch exists? ("Scan meals or log for both with AI help")

## Gate: Assumptions
- [x] Main assumption explicit? (AI delegation produces working features)
- [x] Assumption testable? (Features functional after AI implementation)
- [x] Test method defined? (Manual testing of CR03 and CR05 features)

## Gate: UX Integrity
- [x] Pattern overuse detected? (Some layering complexity from CSC guidelines)
- [x] Cognitive overload risk? (Medium - multiple new features added)
- [x] Information hierarchy clear? (Dashboard remains primary focus)
- [x] Primary action obvious? (Quick Add still prominent)

## Gate: Ethics & Wellbeing
- [x] Dark pattern risk? (None, transparent feature additions)
- [x] Emotional manipulation risk? (None, factual nutrition features)
- [x] Vulnerable user consideration? (Partner logging helps couples)
- [x] Data privacy addressed? (Local storage maintained)

- Some TypeScript errors present (unused variables, type mismatches)
- Design system layering may increase visual complexity</content>
