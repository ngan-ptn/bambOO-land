# Design-Lite Workflow: Social Challenges & Leaderboards

## Step 1: FRAMING
*Combined: Problem reframes + Assumptions + Testable hypothesis*

### Problem Reframes (3 Alternative Views)

**Reframe 1: Social Motivation Gap**
Users complete individual challenges but lack the social accountability and recognition that would sustain long-term engagement. The current solo experience doesn't tap into the powerful motivators of social comparison, friendly competition, and shared achievement.

**Reframe 2: Missing Social Layer**
The app provides excellent challenge mechanics but operates in a social vacuum. Users can track their own progress beautifully, but they can't see how they stack up against others or celebrate wins with friends, creating an incomplete motivation ecosystem.

**Reframe 3: Competition as Catalyst**
Individual motivation follows a natural decay curve without external stimuli. By introducing social challenges and leaderboards, we can create ongoing competitive dynamics that provide fresh motivation waves through social proof, gamification, and peer influence.

### Assumptions (Risk-Rated)

**High Risk Assumptions:**
1. **Social features will increase engagement** - Users actually want to compete socially (vs. preferring private achievement)
2. **Friend networks exist** - Users have friends who also use the app (critical for social features to work)
3. **Competition motivates, not demotivates** - Social comparison will inspire rather than discourage users

**Medium Risk Assumptions:**
4. **Privacy boundaries are clear** - Users are comfortable with friends seeing their progress/activity
5. **Fair competition is possible** - We can design leaderboards that don't advantage power users unfairly
6. **Notification patterns won't annoy** - Social notifications will be seen as valuable, not spammy

**Low Risk Assumptions:**
7. **Technical feasibility** - We can implement friend connections and real-time leaderboards
8. **UI patterns exist** - We can adapt existing challenge cards for social features
9. **Data privacy compliance** - Social features can be built within privacy constraints

### Testable Hypothesis

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
We believe users lose motivation because individual challenges lack the social accountability and recognition that sustains engagement, as evidenced by user feedback about feeling "alone" in their fitness journey.

**Testable Hypothesis:**
IF we build social challenges where users can invite friends to compete on shared goals AND leaderboards showing relative progress and achievements,
THEN daily active users will increase by 25% within 30 days AND user retention will improve by 15% over 90 days,
FOR motivated fitness users aged 25-45 who complete 3+ challenges per week,
BECAUSE social accountability creates peer pressure to maintain streaks AND competitive elements provide extrinsic motivation that complements intrinsic goals.

**Falsification Criteria:**
We're WRONG if:
- <20% of users invite friends to challenges
- Users complain about competitive pressure feeling "demotivating"
- Engagement metrics don't improve or actually decline
- Friend connection features have <5% adoption

**Success Metrics:**
- Friend invitation rate → Pass: >25% of active users  Fail: <10%
- Social challenge completion rate → Pass: >60%  Fail: <30%
- Daily active users → Pass: +20% increase  Fail: No change or decline
- User retention (30-day) → Pass: +15% improvement  Fail: <5% improvement

**AI Recommendation:** Ready for ideation - hypothesis is clear and testable with measurable outcomes.

**Decision:** ✅ Proceed to ideation
**Notes:** Strong alignment with user feedback. Social features complement rather than replace individual motivation.</content>
