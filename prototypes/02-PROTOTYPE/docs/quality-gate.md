# Design Quality Gate: 02-PROTOTYPE (Base Calo Tracker)

**Date:** 2025-01-11
**Phase:** Build

---

## Gate: Concept Clarity
- [x] Core value understandable in ≤10s? (Vietnamese food calorie tracking)
- [x] One-sentence pitch exists? ("Track Vietnamese street food calories in 2 taps")

## Gate: Assumptions
- [x] Main assumption explicit? (S/M/L portions work for Vietnamese food)
- [x] Assumption testable? (User testing validates portion accuracy)
- [x] Test method defined? (Persona testing with Vietnamese food scenarios)

## Gate: UX Integrity
- [x] Pattern overuse detected? (No, clean minimal design)
- [x] Cognitive overload risk? (Low, focused on single task)
- [x] Information hierarchy clear? (Progress ring primary, foods secondary)
- [x] Primary action obvious? (Food tiles are prominent)

## Gate: Ethics & Wellbeing
- [x] Dark pattern risk? (None, transparent calorie tracking)
- [x] Emotional manipulation risk? (None, factual nutrition data)
- [x] Vulnerable user consideration? (Simple interface helps all users)
- [x] Data privacy addressed? (Local storage, no external data sharing)
