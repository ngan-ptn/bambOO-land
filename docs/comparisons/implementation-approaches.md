# Comparison: Implementation Approaches for Feature Development

**Prototypes:** 02a-ai-delegation, 02b-prototype-lite, 02c-prototype-gated, 02d-prototypER
**Base:** 02-PROTOTYPE (Calo Tracker)
**Date:** 2025-01-10
**Status:** In Progress

---

## The Question

Which implementation approach produces the best results when adding a new feature to an existing prototype?

We're comparing 4 different AI-assisted design/development workflows to determine:
- Which is fastest?
- Which produces highest quality output?
- Which requires least iteration/rework?
- Which is best suited for different types of features?

---

## The Feature Being Implemented

**Feature:** [TBD - define before starting comparison]

**Complexity:** [Simple | Medium | Complex]

**Touches:** [UI only | UI + Data | Full stack]

---

## Comparison Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | How to Measure |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **Time to completion** | High | Total time from start to working feature |
| **Number of iterations** | High | How many revision cycles needed |
| **Output quality** | High | Adherence to design system, code quality |
| **Documentation generated** | Medium | Useful artifacts produced along the way |
| **Predictability** | Medium | Was the process consistent and repeatable? |
| **Human intervention required** | Medium | How much manual guidance/correction |
| **Learning curve** | Low | How easy to understand the workflow |

## Approach Descriptions

### 02a: AI Delegation
**Philosophy:** Delegate entire feature implementation to AI with minimal guidance.
**Process:** Describe what you want → AI plans and implements → Review result
**Best for:** [TBD after experiment]

### 02b: Prototype-Lite
**Philosophy:** Condensed 5-step design workflow (merged from full 11 steps).
**Process:** Framing → Ideation → Select → Design → User Flows
**Best for:** [TBD after experiment]

### 02c: Prototype-Gated
**Philosophy:** Full workflow with mandatory gates/checkpoints requiring human approval.
**Process:** Framing → Ideation → GATE → Build → GATE → Validation
**Best for:** [TBD after experiment]

### 02d: PrototypER
**Philosophy:** Structured prototyping with design system constraints.
**Process:** Design tokens → Components → Screens → Integration
**Best for:** [TBD after experiment]
