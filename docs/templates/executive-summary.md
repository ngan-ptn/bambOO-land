# Executive Summary – 5 Design Approaches Comparison

> Audience: Design leadership, product leadership, future self  
> Goal: Communicate insight, not detail.

---

## Context
- A single product problem was explored using **5 different AI-assisted design approaches**.
- All approaches shared the same constraints, domain, and success criteria.
- Objective: understand how AI changes **design thinking, decision quality, and speed**.

---

## Key Findings (TL;DR)
- There is **no single best approach**.
- Each approach excels at a different phase of the design lifecycle.
- AI provides the most value in **problem framing, exploration, and rationale articulation**.
- Poorly structured AI usage increases cognitive load instead of reducing it.

## Comparison Snapshot

| Approach | Best At | Trade-off | Recommended Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Deep exploration | Slow decisions | Early discovery |
| B | Clear decisions | Narrow ideas | Alignment |
| C | Speed | Shallow thinking | Execution |
| D | System coherence | High mental load | Complex domains |
| E | Stakeholder buy-in | Conservative output | Review & handoff |

## Strategic Insight

> AI does not replace design judgment — it **externalizes and amplifies it**.

- Strong designers become clearer and more consistent.
- Weak reasoning becomes visible faster.
- Decision artifacts matter more than visual artifacts.

---

## Recommendation
- Adopt a **hybrid design process**, switching approaches by phase.
- Standardize decision artifacts, not prompts.
- Train designers on **when NOT to use AI** as much as when to use it.

---

## Next Steps
- Codify each approach into a reusable playbook.
- Define phase-based AI usage guidelines.
- Measure learning velocity, not just delivery speed.
