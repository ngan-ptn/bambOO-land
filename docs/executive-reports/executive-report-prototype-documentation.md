## Cross-Prototype Insights

### Implementation Approach Comparison

| Aspect | Manual Implementation (02) | AI-Delegated Implementation (02a) |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Development Speed** | Moderate | Fast |
| **Code Quality** | High | Variable (requires oversight) |
| **Feature Complexity** | Core features | Advanced features (AI, multi-user) |
| **Maintenance Cost** | Low | Medium |
| **Scalability** | Good foundation | Rapid expansion capability |

### Key Findings
1. **Manual implementation excels** at creating stable, well-tested foundations for core product features
2. **AI-delegated implementation excels** at rapidly prototyping advanced, complex user flows
